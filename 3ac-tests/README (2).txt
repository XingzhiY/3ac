These are some test files that you can use to test your assignment,
especially the first 3 exercises.

The files supplied here do *not* require a pre-processor to be
executed. You should be able to load them directly into pycparser.

This, however, means that attempting to compile these files using `gcc
-c`, will give you warnings about implicit declarations. For now, this
is an acceptable state of affairs.
